# Application-of-Logistic-Regression-in-Prediction-of-Coronary-Heart-Disease
This repository contains my Master’s capstone project titled “Application of Logistic Regression in Prediction of Coronary Heart Disease.” This project applies statistical modeling to a real-world healthcare problem using logistic regression, aiming to predict the likelihood of coronary heart disease based on patient data.
📌 Project Title: Application of Logistic Regression in Predicting Coronary Heart Disease
Description:

This repository showcases my Master’s capstone project titled “Application of Logistic Regression in Prediction of Coronary Heart Disease.” The project leverages R programming to apply logistic regression for predicting the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) based on key clinical and demographic variables.

🏅 Ranked First in final project evaluations during my Master’s in Data Science.

Key Highlights:

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis of cardiovascular risk indicators such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more.

📊 Statistical Modeling: Implementation of logistic regression using R to model the probability of CHD occurrence.

🧪 Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve.

💡 Clinical Insights: Interpretation of model coefficients and odds ratios for evidence-based healthcare decision-making.

Tools & Technologies:
R · tidyverse · ggplot2 · caret · ROCR · R Markdown

Dataset:
Publicly available heart disease dataset (e.g., UCI Heart Disease Dataset).
